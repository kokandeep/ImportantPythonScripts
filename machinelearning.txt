Machine Learning
algorithms = 

For supervised ml ==
1. classification - Logistic re ,KNN,SVM,dtc,rfc,naive bayes(
2. regression - sales prediction (prediction algorithms)


logistic regression - - - 
1) y = mx+c 
2) probability must be a +ve we turn to exponential form i.e. e^y = e^(mx+c) 
3) to make the prob less than 1 divide a p by a number greater than y 
4) if p is prob of sucsess then q = (p-1) is prob of failure
equation = log(y/(1-y)) = y




data wrangling  --  will aplyy on series values
$$ to change string to numbers
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder as lb
lb = LabelEncoder()
df['humidity']   = lb.fit_transform(where we are changing )


Imputer
fill the null values of columns having datatypes int float with mean max or in values
imputer will apply on dataframe 


train and test
test_size will take how many values will be tested 


polynomial regression -- 

no predict so we need to put linear regression after
